# Hi, I'm Fredrick Owino Onyango ðŸ‘‹

I am a Computer Science student at the Technical University of Mombasa, passionate about AI and machine learning in agriculture. Currently, Iâ€™m working on an AI-based plant disease detection system to help farmers protect crops and improve yields by detecting plant diseases through machine learning.

## ðŸ›  Projects:
- **[AI Plant Disease Detection System](https://github.com/Fredrick-owino/-plant-disease-detection-CNN)**: An AI system that leverages machine learning and computer vision to detect plant diseases and provide recommendations to farmers.

A convolutional neural network (CNN)-based system for plant disease detection and prediction. The model analyzes plant images, identifies diseases, and provides accurate predictions. Performance is evaluated using a confusion matrix to ensure reliability in real-world agricultural applications.

## ðŸŒ± Currently Learning:
- Mobile app development using Flutter for integrating AI systems in farming.
- Advanced Machine Learning techniques for agriculture tech solutions.
